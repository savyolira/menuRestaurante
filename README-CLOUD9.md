# Assessment: Style a Restaurant's Menu

In this assessment, we will provide you with a simple restaurant menu, with **two** included stylesheets that (initially) don't do much. However, the stylesheets contain comments providing partial directions on how to customize the appearance of the menu.

You'll need to download the **`'04-style-restaurant-menu'`** folder from cloud9 environment which is shared with you (In Cloud9 go to your Dashboard and in the left nav you will see 'Shared with you'). Upload the folder to your Cloud9 environment.

You will be taking a restaurant's menu and styling it into two different designs using CSS.

The included index.html file contains the menu, and a simple navigation bar allowing you to toggle between two different CSS files, style1.css and style2.css. For now, those two files provide very little styling. However, they do contain comments which suggest style rules you can add or modify to provide a more custom appearance.

The two screenshot examples provided show what the restaurant's menu will look like if you complete all the tasks specified in the comments in the two stylesheets.

Some of the CSS features may be new to you - be prepared to use a search engine to look for syntax and usage examples for any that are unfamiliar to you.

When you have finished filling in the 2 stylesheets, please submit your Cloud9 environment url for the assignment.

If you are able to complete all the suggested styling, the menu will look as shown in the following screenshots.
